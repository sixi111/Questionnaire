The three dimpled white balls were slowly drifting to the right across the marble floor while keeping their relative depths and occlusions mostly consistent, as if a gentle horizontal force is sliding the cluster rightward with slight separation between the nearer right ball and the two farther balls. The viewpoint was largely static with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
