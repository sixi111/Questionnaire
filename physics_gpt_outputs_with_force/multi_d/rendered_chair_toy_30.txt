The yellow rubber duck was initially sitting centered on the chair seat, then it rose upward in front of the chair back, hovered briefly while bobbing slightly, and then dropped forward onto the seat where it tumbled and rolled toward the front-left edge before falling off the chair and exiting the frame at the bottom-left, as if an upward lift first pulls it up and then gravity and momentum make it topple and roll off. The viewpoint was fixed and did not move, and the background remains unchanged.
