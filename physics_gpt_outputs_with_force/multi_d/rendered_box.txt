The three cardboard boxes were initially aligned on the tabletop (small–medium–tall from left to right), then the tall right box was lifted upward while the left and middle boxes stayed put, as if an upward force is pulling the tall box off the surface. Next, the middle box was lifted upward to roughly mid-height between the left and right boxes, as if an upward force is raising it while keeping it level. Finally, the tall box was lowered back down to the tabletop and the middle box descended back to its original position, restoring the initial aligned arrangement, as if the lifting forces are released and gravity returns them to rest. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
