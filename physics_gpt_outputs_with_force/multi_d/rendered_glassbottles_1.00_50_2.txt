The three bottles were initially standing upright side‑by‑side on the tabletop, then they collectively lifted slightly and began tipping to the right in a smooth, continuous motion, as if a steady sideways push and gravity are pulling them into a rightward fall; the right (dark) bottle falls first onto its side, followed by the middle (clear) bottle and then the left (white) bottle, ending with the bottles lying on the table and sliding slightly right. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
