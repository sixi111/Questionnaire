The group of four orange-and-white traffic cones started standing upright in a loose cluster, then one cone slid slightly and began to tip, as if a lateral push is destabilizing it. That cone continued rotating and lifting, its square base flipping up into the air while the cone body tilts and spins, as if a torque is twisting it around its base. Near the end, one cone remains upright on the left while the other cones end up toppled/partly on their sides with their bases visible, as if gravity is pulling them down after the flip. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
