The red ball was smoothly rolling diagonally down and slightly left toward the black ball, as if a gentle push is driving it across the felt until it makes contact and then settles. The black ball was mostly stationary at first and then remained fixed while the red ball comes to rest against it, as if it is heavier or pinned by friction. The yellow ball was stationary throughout, as if no force is applied to it. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
