The teddy bear was initially sitting upright on the wooden floor, then lifted smoothly upward into a hovering position, as if an invisible upward force is suspending it in midair; afterward it gradually lowered while pitching forward, transitioning into a forward fall until it ended face-down on the floor, as if gravity is pulling it down and tipping it forward. The viewpoint was fixed and centered with no camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
