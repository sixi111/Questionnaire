The plush toy dog was lifted straight up from the floor into a hover, stayed suspended at a nearly constant height for several moments, then pitched forward and descended until it dropped onto its face, after which it rose back up and returned to an upright seated pose, as if an invisible vertical force is levitating it and then releasing it before pulling it back into position. The viewpoint was fixed and centered with no noticeable camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
