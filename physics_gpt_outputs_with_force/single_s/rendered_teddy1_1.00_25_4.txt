The teddy bear was lifted off the dusty floor into a brief hover and then gradually tipped to its right, rotating as if an invisible force is raising it and then pulling it sideways until it falls onto its side and rolls slightly. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable pan/tilt/zoom, and the background remains unchanged.
