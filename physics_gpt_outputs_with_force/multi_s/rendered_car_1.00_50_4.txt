The four toy cars (red, silver, bronze, and blue) were initially aligned in a straight row, then the silver car smoothly moved forward toward the camera, as if a steady pulling force is dragging it straight outward from the lineup; near the end, the blue car subtly shifted to the right, as if a light sideways nudge is pushing it away from the group. The viewpoint was essentially fixed with no noticeable pan/tilt/zoom, and the background remains unchanged.
