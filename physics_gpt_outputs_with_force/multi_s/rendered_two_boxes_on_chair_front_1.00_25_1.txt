The two cardboard boxes stacked on a black stool were initially hovering slightly apart, then the lower box shifted and the whole stack began tipping to the viewer’s right, as if gravity is pulling the boxes off-balance and dragging the stool into a fall until the stool collapses onto its side and the boxes slide partially out of frame to the left. The viewpoint was fixed and static, and the background remains unchanged.
