The five wooden blocks were initially standing upright in a straight row, then they progressively tilted outward: the far-left block fell down toward the left and ended lying flat on the table, and the far-right block fell down toward the right and ended lying flat on the table, while the three middle blocks remained standing upright and stable, as if a gentle sideways push and gravity are tipping the two outer blocks away from the center. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
