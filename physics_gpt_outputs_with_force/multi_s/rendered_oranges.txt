The five oranges were initially resting in a straight row on the tabletop, then the whole row rose smoothly into the air and drifted slightly to the right, as if an invisible upward force is levitating them while a gentle rightward push is carrying them. The rightmost orange moved farther right than the others and gradually exited the frame, while the remaining four oranges stayed evenly spaced and eventually settled into a stable hover/position with minimal motion. The viewpoint was fixed with no camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
