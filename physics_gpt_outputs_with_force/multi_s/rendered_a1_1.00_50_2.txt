The three glowing green spheres were initially hovering in a straight horizontal row above the center of a neon-edged half-pipe, then they descended together into the ramp, briefly compressing into a clustered formation near the lowest point, and finally continued drifting as a tighter group along the ramp’s curvature, as if gravity is pulling them down and the ramp’s curved surface is guiding/containing their motion. The viewpoint was fixed and centered with no noticeable pan/tilt/zoom, and the background remains unchanged.
