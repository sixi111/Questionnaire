The red apple and the green apple started side-by-side on the surface, then both lifted off the ground together and drifted apart horizontally while slowly rotating/tilting in midair, as if an upward force is levitating them and a gentle sideways force is pushing them away from each other. The viewpoint was fixed with no camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
