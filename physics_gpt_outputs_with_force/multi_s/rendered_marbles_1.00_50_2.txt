The row of clear glass spheres was gradually spread apart along the horizontal surface from start to finish, as if a gentle lateral force is pushing some spheres leftward and others rightward, increasing the gaps between them while they remain resting on the surface. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable pan/tilt/zoom, and the background remains unchanged.
