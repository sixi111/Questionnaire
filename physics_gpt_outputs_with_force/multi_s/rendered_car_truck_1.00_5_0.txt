The blue sports car was stationary and kept its front-facing orientation from start to finish, as if no external force is acting on it beyond contact support from the floor. The yellow dump truck started upright next to the blue car, then progressively tilted/rolled to its left (toward the blue car) and partially lifted its right-side wheels off the ground, as if a lateral push and gravity are causing it to lean onto the blue car and pivot around its left wheels. The viewpoint was fixed and centered with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
