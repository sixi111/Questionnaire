The whole avocado and the cut avocado half were smoothly lifted off the green surface and drifted apart while subtly rotating, as if an invisible upward force is suspending them in midair and a gentle lateral pull is separating them. The viewpoint was mostly fixed with a slight leftward pan/reframe as the objects move, and the background remains unchanged.
