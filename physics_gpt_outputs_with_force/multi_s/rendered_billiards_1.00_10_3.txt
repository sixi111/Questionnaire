The yellow ball stayed stationary on the left side of the green table from start to finish, as if no external force is applied to it. The black ball rolled steadily rightward and slightly upward toward the red ball and then came to rest close beside it, as if a gentle push is driving it across the felt until friction stops it. The red ball remained nearly stationary at first and then drifted slightly leftward and downward to meet the black ball, as if a mild residual force is sliding it a short distance before it settles. The viewpoint was fixed with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
