The three oranges were initially resting side-by-side on the tabletop, then they gradually lifted off the surface and hovered, as if an upward force is levitating them and adjusting their spacing; afterward, the left and right oranges sink back down and appear slightly squashed against the table while the middle orange remains floating higher, then the middle orange lowers and the three drift laterally with small height and tilt changes, as if the levitating force is weakening and redistributing between them before settling toward a new arrangement. The viewpoint was fixed with no camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
