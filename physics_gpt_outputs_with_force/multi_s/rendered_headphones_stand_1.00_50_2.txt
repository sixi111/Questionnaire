The headphones were smoothly rotating around the vertical stand from start to finish, as if a steady motorized torque is spinning them clockwise (from a front-facing view through side/back views and returning toward a front view) while staying attached at the top support. The viewpoint was fixed and centered with no camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
