The row of white rectangular domino-like blocks was gradually pushed/tilted into a shallow inward “valley” shape and then partially collapsed so that the right-hand group leaned to the right while the left-hand group remained more upright, as if a lateral force is applied and the blocks’ contact forces propagate the leaning through the line. The viewpoint was fixed with no noticeable camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
