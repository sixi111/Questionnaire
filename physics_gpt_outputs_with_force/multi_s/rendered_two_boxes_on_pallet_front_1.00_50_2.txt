The four boxes on the wooden pallet were initially stacked upright in two columns, then the two top boxes (a dark brown box on the left and a light cream box on the right) lifted off and tilted outward while the two bottom boxes slid and tipped away from the center, as if an upward force first pops the top boxes loose and then a lateral outward force pushes the stacks apart. The dark brown top box drifted leftward while rotating and then descended toward the center of the pallet, as if gravity is pulling it down after a brief suspension. On the right, the cream top box and the right bottom box leaned and slid to the right, partially exiting the frame, as if they are pushed and then left to settle under gravity. The viewpoint was fixed and centered with no camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
