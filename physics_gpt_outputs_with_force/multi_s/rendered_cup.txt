The three paper cups were initially standing upright in a row, then the middle cup was lifted straight upward and held hovering, as if an upward force is pulling it off the tabletop. Next, the left and right cups rose slightly and rotated outward, as if opposing lateral forces are tipping them away from the center while they float. Then the left and right cups continued rotating until they lay on their sides on the tabletop, while the middle cup gradually tilted and descended, as if gravity is taking over and letting it settle into a slanted, partially supported position between them. The viewpoint was fixed with no camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
