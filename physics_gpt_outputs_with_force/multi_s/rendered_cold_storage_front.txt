The three white storage bins were smoothly lifted off the floor and rose to a uniform mid-air height while slightly drifting laterally (the left bin drifting a bit left, the right bin a bit right, and the center bin staying near the middle), as if an invisible upward force is levitating them; they then gradually descended back down and settled into an evenly spaced row on the floor. The viewpoint was fixed and centered with no camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
