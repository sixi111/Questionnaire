The multicolored ball was rolling and slightly bouncing along the top of the wooden bench from left to right, rotating continuously as if a gentle push and gravity are driving it forward while small impacts with the bench surface cause brief hops. It then left the bench edge and dropped into the wooden barrel, as if gravity is pulling it down and the barrel rim guides it inside; afterward it sank deeper until it was no longer visible. The viewpoint was fixed and steady with no camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
