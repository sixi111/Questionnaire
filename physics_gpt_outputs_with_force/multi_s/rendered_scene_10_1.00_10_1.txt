The three gray balls were sliding smoothly from left to right across the wooden tabletop, then sequentially leaving the table’s right edge and passing near/over the open top of the wooden barrel, as if a steady horizontal push is driving them off the table and gravity is pulling them downward once they lose support. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
