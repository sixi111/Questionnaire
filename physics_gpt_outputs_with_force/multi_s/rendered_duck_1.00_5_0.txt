The three yellow rubber ducks were initially aligned side-by-side on the bathtub rim, then the middle duck smoothly lifted upward and hovered above the surface while the left and right ducks subtly drifted outward and rotated slightly (left duck turning a bit left, right duck turning a bit right), as if an upward force is lifting the middle duck while a gentle lateral force is separating the two side ducks. The viewpoint was static with no camera pan/tilt/zoom, and the background remains unchanged.
