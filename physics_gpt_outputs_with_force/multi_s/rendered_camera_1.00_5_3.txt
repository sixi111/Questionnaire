The two cameras were initially resting side-by-side on the wooden table, then they were simultaneously lifted to hover above the table while slightly tilting away from each other, as if an upward force is raising both bodies while a mild rotational torque is pitching them outward. They continued hovering briefly with small, smooth changes in roll/pitch, then descended together and settled back onto the tabletop into a stable, side-by-side position, as if the upward force is gradually removed and gravity returns them to rest. The viewpoint was fixed and centered with no noticeable pan/tilt/zoom, and the background remains unchanged.
