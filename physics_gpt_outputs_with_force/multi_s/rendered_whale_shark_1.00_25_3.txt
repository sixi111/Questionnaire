The gray shark plush was smoothly lifted up and forward from the right side toward the blue whale plush, then hovered above it and gradually drifted rightward while pitching downward, as if an invisible hand is raising it and then letting it glide and tip before moving it out of frame. The blue whale plush stayed on the left and subtly rotated/tilted in place with minor settling, as if a light nudge is shifting its body weight without relocating it. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
