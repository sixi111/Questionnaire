The four bricks started as two neat side-by-side stacks (two bricks on the left and two on the right), then the top bricks slid outward and tilted away from the center, as if a lateral force is pulling the top bricks apart while gravity keeps them resting on the lower bricks. The right top brick continued rotating clockwise and dropping until it leaned diagonally between the left stack and the right bottom brick, as if it briefly pivots on an edge and then settles under gravity. The viewpoint was fixed with no noticeable camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
