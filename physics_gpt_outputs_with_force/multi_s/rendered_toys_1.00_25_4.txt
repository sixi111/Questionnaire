The green dinosaur plush was initially sitting upright near the center-left beside the small silver robot, then it gradually lifted upward off the floor and hovered in place, as if an invisible upward force is raising it while keeping its body facing forward. After the robot moved away, the dinosaur slowly leaned forward and to its right, as if gravity is pulling its head and torso down, until it ended up slumped low with its head near the floor.

The small silver robot toy was standing to the right of the dinosaur at the start, then it slid/walked steadily toward the right edge while slightly rotating its body orientation, as if a gentle horizontal push is moving it across the floor, until it exited the frame.

The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera motion or zoom, and the background remains unchanged.
