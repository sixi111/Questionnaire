The beach ball was lowered smoothly down into the open cardboard box until it disappeared from view, then later rose back up slightly above the box rim before sinking down again, as if gravity is pulling it into the box with a mild rebound/bobbing motion. The viewpoint was static with no camera movement, and the background remains unchanged.
