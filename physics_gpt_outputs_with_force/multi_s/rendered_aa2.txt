The small white ball was initially resting on the wooden tabletop to the left of the bowl, then it rose smoothly into the air and drifted rightward until it hovered above the bowl, as if an upward lift and forward push are guiding it into position. It then descended into the bowl and settled inside, as if gravity is pulling it down and the bowl is catching and containing it. The bowl stayed in place at first, then gradually tipped and rolled slightly to the right while the ball remained inside, as if a sideways force is nudging the bowl and causing it to lean and rotate on its base. The viewpoint was static with no noticeable camera motion, and the background remains unchanged.
