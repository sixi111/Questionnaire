The two cameras remained still on the tabletop at first, then together began to rise smoothly off the surface and hover while keeping roughly the same spacing, as if an invisible upward force were lifting them in unison. While airborne, they tilt and rotate slightly toward and away from each other and then gradually rotate back, and finally descend and settle back onto the tabletop in almost their original side‑by‑side pose, as if the lifting force weakened and gravity gently pulled them down.

The blue sports car was stationary from start to finish, remaining fixed in place without any noticeable translation or rotation, as if no external force is acting on it and it is firmly anchored to the ground. The yellow dump truck was repeatedly rocked and tilted to its left side (toward the car) and then partially back toward upright in a smooth, pendulum-like motion, as if an unseen hand or lateral force is pushing its upper body to lean toward the car and then easing off so it swings slightly back, with its contact point near the car staying roughly fixed while the body pivots around it.

The ball was then accelerated smoothly upward from the table and moved in a continuous arc-like path: first lifting off and traveling left-to-right and slightly upward, then hovering briefly above the bowl at roughly constant height, before descending and dropping into the bowl, after which the combined ball–bowl system began to tip and rock. The bowl itself remained fixed at first, then began to respond to the ball’s impact by tilting and rotating around its base edge on the table surface, rocking progressively farther to the right until it leaned at a pronounced angle and then continued to pivot onto its rim, as if an invisible horizontal and vertical impulse had been imparted by the ball’s landing, causing the bowl to roll and tip under gravity and torque.

The red car remained fixed in place throughout, as if it were anchored to the ground with no horizontal or vertical force acting on it. The silver car had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The silver car gradually slid forward and slightly to the left relative to the camera, as if a gentle forward-left pulling force were drawing it out from the original four‑car line toward the viewer. The brown car had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The brown car stayed nearly fixed in its original position, with only very slight relative shifting as if minor forces were nudging it but not truly moving it. The blue car had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The blue car likewise stayed essentially fixed in place, as if held by an invisible restraint with no net force displacing it.

The viewpoint was fixed in a stable, front-facing position with no noticeable camera motion or change in perspective throughout the sequence.",2av8z2fr5hrmy0cvvbsb92byx0,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_24_Initially_the_five__2av8z2fr.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/eTfWI3zr2edRCoHg4rNWvx5IjdmLPWx9chpJr48DHLoocheXB/tmpkg0_yzld.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:34.988Z,2026-01-20T10:31:49.038300295Z,5,16:9
job_0,rendered_a1_1.00_50_2,"Initially, the three glowing green spheres had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary in a horizontal row above the center of the white curved platform. The three glowing green spheres were then pulled downward together toward the center of the platform, briefly touched and rolled along the surface, and continued oscillating and sliding around as a tightly grouped cluster, as if a gravitational force is pulling them into and along the curved “bowl” of the platform.

job_29,rendered_toys_1.00_25_4,"Initially, the green dinosaur plush had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary, and the small robot toy had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The green dinosaur plush was first sitting still beside the robot, then rose slightly and drifted smoothly to the right while hovering above the floor, as if an invisible hand were lifting it and gliding it sideways to the right. After the robot exits the frame, the dinosaur gently settles closer to the floor and gradually rotates its head and upper body downward, then its whole body tilts forward and slowly lowers until it ends up lying down on the floor facing downward, as if a gentle forward‑tilting torque is being applied that makes it bow and then lie prone. The robot toy remained upright at first beside the dinosaur, then was steadily pulled to the right across the floor and out of the frame, maintaining roughly the same upright orientation, as if a constant horizontal force is dragging it to the right. The viewpoint was fixed in place with a stable camera: the background room, rug, and shelves remain static and unchanged, indicating no camera movement or change in viewpoint throughout the sequence.",ytrx5jzrzdrmt0cvvbs99kmg6c,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_29_Initially_the_green_ytrx5jzr.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/D09Kli8gMoLABhP0LDmLkAHkA1JEix0KhZvLqdJv3eY9WofVA/tmpe1yxyipn.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:35.195Z,2026-01-20T10:31:22.899101794Z,5,16:9
job_22,rendered_marbles_1.00_50_2,"Initially, the seven glass-like spheres each had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary. The spheres were then set into a coordinated wave-like rolling motion along the horizontal line from left to right: the leftmost spheres gradually rolled rightward and slightly separated, while the rightmost spheres alternated between remaining in place and subtly shifting, so that the overall row shortened from seven to about five clearly separated spheres as if a gentle horizontal force were nudging the spheres to the right one after another, causing small, smooth positional shifts without any jumps or deformation.

The top-left dark box was then lifted and moved smoothly upward and slightly left, tilting and later dropping toward the pallet and ending back on the pallet near the center, as if an invisible upward and then downward force is picking it up from its top-left position, swinging it through the air, and setting it back down. The top-right light box was lifted and moved upward and slightly right, then arced down toward the right side and out of frame, as if a strong push is knocking it off the stack to the right. The bottom-left box was first stationary, then began to tilt and lift slightly as the upper motion disturbed it, finally rising and drifting leftward and out of frame, as if a sideways force from the left is pulling it away from the pallet. The bottom-right box remained stationary at first, then tipped and slid off the pallet to the right and out of frame, as if pushed sideways and downward off the pallet. The wooden pallet itself remained stationary throughout, as if fixed to the floor with no external forces acting on it. The viewpoint was fixed in front of the pallet and boxes with no noticeable camera movement, maintaining a stable, centered perspective for the entire sequence.",ptvnxz03m1rmt0cvvbst5mven8,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_31_Initially_the_four__ptvnxz03.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/4B08xaa0cNbLNNJet7JU8x3gkaieNjaDNuX2c6YsacpRuQfrA/tmph9w15z1s.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:37.92Z,2026-01-20T10:31:45.695860636Z,5,16:9

The headphones were smoothly rotating in place around the vertical support of the stand in a nearly complete 360-degree loop, while also subtly flexing and bending around the stand, as if an invisible hand were gently twisting and wrapping the headband around the central post before returning it to its original symmetrical position. The stand itself remained fixed in space without translating or rotating. The viewpoint was static and centered, keeping the headphones and stand in the same frontal composition throughout the sequence.",0r986hfwyxrmr0cvvbs9zc6ecc,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_21_Initially_the_headp_0r986hfw.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/SABEfbksy2WRHy7hBxNIlDf3wQycIaD4SeKV8s568gtlcheXB/tmpy37b1jvf.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:36.215Z,2026-01-20T10:31:46.107642532Z,5,16:9

The boxing gloves were smoothly swung from a centered, hanging position on the hook toward the right and slightly forward, then one glove detached and moved rightward and closer to the camera while rotating, as if an unseen hand or force is pulling and lifting the gloves off the hook and carrying one glove to the right side of the frame. The viewpoint was fixed in front of the wall and hook, without noticeable camera movement.",76xn487kr1rmt0cvvbsbzt94h8,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_20_Initially_the_boxin_76xn487k.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/emkz67AhTJ2IV6SzFdoCf3cPA1ny6FVbJ7EEl0V3QmcStQfrA/tmpcnf4lyhe.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:33.856Z,2026-01-20T10:30:43.661280524Z,5,16:9
job_8,rendered_box_row,"Initially, the four cardboard boxes had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary. The first (leftmost) box then rotated slightly in place, pivoting so that its top edge swings backward and forward into a new angled orientation relative to the other three boxes, as if a gentle twisting force is applied to the leftmost box while the other boxes remain fixed in position. The viewpoint was fixed in an oblique, slightly elevated perspective above the ground plane, with no noticeable camera movement throughout the sequence.",prkqj8ear1rmt0cvvbs8e42k88,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_8_Initially_the_four__prkqj8ea.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/jvfw43WeHKnHeJsts9FfOoxA2fUZ90lIXvI7oIRo16zwoF6vC/tmp7_glsuyf.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:23.36Z,2026-01-20T10:30:30.466053183Z,5,16:9

The three oranges were then lifted smoothly off the surface and translated through the air in a coordinated, circular/rotational path around their common center, with one or more oranges at different times rising, hovering, and then descending, as if an invisible hand were gently picking them up, juggling them in a controlled loop while preserving their spacing and orientation consistency in 3D. The viewpoint was fixed in front of the oranges with no noticeable camera motion, keeping a constant perspective on the scene throughout the sequence.",59b0wx7qs5rmw0cvvbsa984ezw,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_23_Initially_the_three_59b0wx7q.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/1jrPMIjrpewrSaeAxF2KZ86Zum0zKGfChGJKF9neLthH1C9XB/tmphk2igppc.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:34.889Z,2026-01-20T10:30:42.744166743Z,5,16:9

The blue whale plush remained mostly fixed on the ground in the same spot throughout the sequence, with only very slight shifts in orientation, as if it were a heavy object providing a stable base under a gentle external influence. The gray shark plush gradually lifted off the ground, arced upward and over the blue whale, then continued its motion to the right and slightly downward until it exited the frame on the right, as if an invisible hand or string were pulling it in a smooth, continuous path around and past the whale. The viewpoint was static and did not noticeably change position, angle, or zoom during the entire sequence.",rdexx905s9rmt0cvvbstw8v8y0,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_33_Initially_the_blue__rdexx905.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/lHN7ef8fzXVrfRVVWvMIQ0blIOcNnchoi63GRqO41iLF5C9XB/tmpqyppdyhz.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:38.474Z,2026-01-20T10:31:45.613152928Z,5,16:9
job_34,rendered_wood_blocks_1.00_10_0,"Initially, the five wooden blocks had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary. The blocks underwent a smooth, coordinated tumbling motion from left to right: the leftmost block began to tip and fall rightward, successively causing each adjacent block to tilt and then lift off the table, as if an invisible pushing force from the left were knocking them over in a domino-like chain reaction, after which they gradually settled back into an upright, evenly spaced configuration by the end. The viewpoint was fixed in front of the blocks at a constant distance and angle, with no noticeable camera movement.",dvfm4pg50drmw0cvvbsrcbyeq4,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/kling_demo/multi_s/job_34_Initially_the_five__dvfm4pg5.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/EeKOYjBtQBXJOKJz1jpBg7pkRjBTkfxKPQP0gKcdsbtSuQfrA/tmpb46vypy6.mp4,2026-01-20T10:28:38.275Z,2026-01-20T10:31:46.061654053Z,5,16:9

The boxes were first hovering, then settling into contact and tipping together with the chair in a smooth, continuous falling and rotating motion, as if gravity is pulling the combined box–chair stack forward and down to the floor. The chair was supporting the boxes and then rotated forward, pivoting over its front legs and eventually landing on its side while the boxes slid and rotated off to the left, as if an external push had tipped the assembly over and gravity continued to drive the fall.

Initially, the black ball had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The yellow, red, and black balls remain fixed on the green surface for the entire sequence while the apparent motion comes solely from the camera: the balls keep constant positions relative to each other, as if an invisible force is rigidly holding all three balls together in place while only the viewpoint orbits around them.
