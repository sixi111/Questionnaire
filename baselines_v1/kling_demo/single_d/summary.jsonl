The blue toy car then began to rotate smoothly in place on the wooden floor, turning from directly facing the camera to a front‑three‑quarter angle and then to a clear side‑three‑quarter angle, as if an invisible hand is gently spinning it on the spot without noticeably translating it across the floor.
