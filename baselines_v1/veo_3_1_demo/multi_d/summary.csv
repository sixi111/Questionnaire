job_1,rendered_billiards_1.00_25_3,"Initially, the yellow ball had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The yellow ball remained fixed in position throughout the entire sequence, as if no horizontal force is acting on it and it is resting stably on the table surface.    Initially, the red ball had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The red ball first moves slightly downward and leftward toward the black ball, briefly contacting or nearly contacting it, and then both balls move together leftward and slightly upward so that by the end the red ball is above and a bit left of the black ball, as if a gentle, sustained lateral force is pushing the pair of balls across the felt.    Initially, the black ball had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The black ball is struck or pulled leftward and a bit upward after the red ball comes close, and then it travels together with the red ball so that the two form a vertical pair to the right of the yellow ball at the end, as if a soft but continuous force is dragging it along in tandem with the red ball.    The viewpoint was fixed in position and orientation above the table, with no noticeable camera motion or change in zoom.",nfktghsjzdrmr0cvvazv5wbcf0,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_1_Initially_the_yello_nfktghsj.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/o2SOLmfJtywzTSqPmgmOKHdCeCJ6OEY6psZLlA5E7AQfuf8XB/tmp20ex04jy.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:02.171Z,2026-01-20T09:33:19.320607607Z,5,16:9
job_2,rendered_bowl_1.00_10_0,"Initially, the larger bowl had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. Initially, the smaller bowl had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The larger bowl remained fixed on the ground throughout the sequence, while the smaller bowl first slid slightly to the right, then smoothly rose upward into the air, translated left to be centered above the larger bowl, and then descended and nested inside it, finally coming to rest, as if an invisible controlled force is lifting, guiding, and gently placing the smaller bowl into the larger one. The viewpoint was fixed in a static, frontal three-quarter view with no apparent camera movement.",sjw1q91k55rmt0cvvazvg6gmq0,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_2_Initially_the_large_sjw1q91k.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/N9mLGPvdEzqINBtd5q020eRCYnE47GcCfVcZFSPHyv1H4PfrA/tmpxl42et2l.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:02.217Z,2026-01-20T09:33:59.784937761Z,5,16:9
job_5,rendered_chair_toy_19,"Initially, the alien toy had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary on the center of the chair seat, and the wooden chair, bedroom furniture, lights, and background all had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary. The alien toy was then slowly tipped to its right side and began to fall in a smooth, continuous arc off the right edge of the chair, rotating and sliding as if gravity were pulling it downward off the seat; after leaving the chair, it continued to tumble and slide along the carpet, ending lying on the floor to the right of the chair, as if it had completed a gentle fall and roll driven purely by gravity. The wooden chair and the rest of the bedroom scene (bed, dresser, lights, carpet, walls, and decorations) remained fixed and unmoving for the entire sequence, as if they were rigidly anchored in place. The viewpoint was fixed in a stable, frontal position facing the chair from the same distance and angle throughout, with no noticeable camera motion or zoom.",gdzqbbsn21rmt0cvvazs21p67w,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_5_Initially_the_alien_gdzqbbsn.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/GGtcZgDUSloXF9fMSQl7RcffSnecwzOXEG7i3I57EWTYdf5vC/tmpqcfu98l9.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:02.704Z,2026-01-20T09:33:10.166297269Z,5,16:9
job_8,rendered_cone_1.00_50_3,"Initially, the four traffic cones each had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary. The left‑front cone was then lifted upward, tilted, and spun around in front of and above the other cones before falling and knocking them over, as if an invisible hand were grabbing that cone and swinging it in an arc that topples the group. The viewpoint was fixed in place above the ground, with no noticeable camera movement throughout the sequence.",a7fenv1qs5rmt0cvvazr8wzwqc,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_8_Initially_the_four__a7fenv1q.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/zJllQCEWf83JYqgUFgWO6pvUDHWe7rruKwAMcDppqO7Y4PfrA/tmp4ma6v126.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:03.401Z,2026-01-20T09:34:16.658360476Z,5,16:9
job_0,rendered_ball_1.00_50_4,"Initially, the three golf balls each had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary. The three golf balls were then translated smoothly to the right together across the flat marble-like surface, maintaining a rigid configuration and constant spacing relative to each other, as if a steady horizontal force is dragging the entire cluster to the right as one solid group without any rotation or internal motion. The viewpoint was fixed and did not change, with no apparent camera movement or change in perspective throughout the sequence.",wpk6e51jb9rmw0cvvazsqbqgc4,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_0_Initially_the_three_wpk6e51j.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/CfPU0wXufWhsskbkcTA3m4AGRh4xUf4plGhM4lWr4F26uf8XB/tmpd6g3cg_5.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:02.01Z,2026-01-20T09:33:17.766451121Z,5,16:9
job_3,rendered_box,"Initially, the left box had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary, the middle box had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary, and the right box had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The left and middle boxes remained fixed in place on the surface for the entire sequence, while the right box was smoothly lifted upward from the surface and then lowered back down to its original position, as if an invisible upward then downward force is pulling it vertically while keeping its horizontal position essentially unchanged. The viewpoint was fixed in a stable, frontal position with no noticeable change in camera angle, zoom, or perspective throughout the clip.",c5c4j91gh5rmr0cvvazs68tw20,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_3_Initially_the_left__c5c4j91g.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/ZLFDvbunUL4VHRH3i8ZbgOLIhTQeeC8CG83xVxQyoJAY3PfrA/tmpobl_urei.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:01.545Z,2026-01-20T09:33:12.795402084Z,5,16:9
job_4,rendered_chair_toy_05,"Initially, the teddy bear had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The teddy bear was then smoothly rotated and translated off the right side of the chair, pivoting around its contact point with the seat and then falling downward and forward to the floor on the right, as if an invisible hand were tipping it over and gravity were pulling it down to the ground. The chair had an initial velocity of zero and remained completely stationary throughout, as if fixed rigidly to the floor. The floor and background wall also had an initial velocity of zero and stayed fixed and unmoving for the entire sequence, as if they were part of a static environment. The viewpoint was fixed in a frontal position, with no noticeable camera motion, maintaining the same perspective on the chair and teddy bear from start to finish.",fkkfgahpb5rmw0cvvazt8nahd0,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_4_Initially_the_teddy_fkkfgahp.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/OH7Hcffp7IgSfJUKL7SSFEcNXNn1vrym2bB91LNjykfxeezfKA/tmp3uq770di.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:03.033Z,2026-01-20T09:33:32.656688238Z,5,16:9
job_9,rendered_glassbottles_1.00_50_2,"Initially, the left white bottle, the middle transparent bottle, and the right metallic bottle each had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary. The three bottles then began to move together smoothly to the right while gradually tilting and lifting off the surface, as if an invisible horizontal force from the left were pushing the group to the right and slightly upward in a coordinated, rigid-body-like motion. As time progressed, the bottles became more tilted, transitioned into a brief hovering phase, and then continued sliding and rotating rightward until the left and middle bottles exited the frame and the right metallic bottle came to rest on its side near the lower-right area of the image, as if gravity and contact with the surface eventually stopped its motion. The viewpoint was fixed in place, maintaining a consistent camera position and angle throughout the entire sequence.",dxsp009fs1rmy0cvvazvb6563w,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_9_Initially_the_left__dxsp009f.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/adFQwGkNSoaLKtFdYXDhDcrZr5CNRZ0g6nwAFtXRqiV39zfKA/tmpoc9aee8s.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:01.352Z,2026-01-20T09:33:18.111116123Z,5,16:9
job_6,rendered_chair_toy_25,"Initially, the stuffed tiger toy had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary, and the wooden chair also had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The stuffed tiger toy was smoothly moving in a circular/oval orbit around the center of the chair in front view: it started sitting centered on the seat, then rose upward above the seat, continued its path while shifting slightly left and right, and then gradually descended and moved to the viewer’s right side of the seat, as if an invisible hand were carrying the toy along a precise looped trajectory around the chair. The wooden chair remained fixed in place without any motion or deformation for the entire sequence, as if firmly anchored to the floor. The viewpoint was fixed in a frontal position with constant distance and framing, with no noticeable camera pan, tilt, zoom, or rotation.",6tw4e01n1nrmw0cvvazvg4yx9w,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_6_Initially_the_stuff_6tw4e01n.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/4ti3u3jy1X69BRSClYt4LAGSIR0EnrSm10O10Mm3Ovh49zfKA/tmpffd0zsrj.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:02.701Z,2026-01-20T09:33:22.231611275Z,5,16:9
job_7,rendered_chair_toy_30,"Initially, the wooden chair had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The duck toy had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary, standing upright at the center of the chair seat. The duck toy was then lifted smoothly upward and slightly backward so that it rose above the seat and hovered in front of the chair back, then continued to move in a leftward arc while rotating, as if an invisible hand were tossing it in a looping path over the left side of the chair. It fell back down onto the seat near the front edge, tumbled and rolled on its side toward the right-back area of the seat, then was lifted again from behind and carried in a large arc around the back of the chair and forward along the right side, finally exiting the frame toward the bottom-left foreground, as if a sustained external force were repeatedly grabbing, throwing, and guiding it around the chair. The chair remained fixed in place and did not move throughout. The viewpoint was static and locked in front of the chair, with no apparent panning, tilting, or zooming.",veccc9syb1rmr0cvvazvfw7698,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/multi_d/job_7_Initially_the_woode_veccc9sy.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/mod1sk61Okb2N1nuc2HHCVu2PQhkIkQjL3AVTsUC9JN59zfKA/tmpnvhjryzi.mp4,2026-01-20T09:32:05.08Z,2026-01-20T09:33:25.355179141Z,5,16:9
