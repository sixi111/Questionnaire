job_3,rendered_drone_1.00_50_2,"Initially, the drone had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary on the helipad. The drone was first resting motionless, then smoothly took off vertically from the center of the marked circle, hovered briefly while rotating slightly in place, and then descended back down to land gently in almost the same orientation, as if a controlled upward thrust is lifting it off the pad and then reducing to let it settle back. The viewpoint was fixed in front of the drone at a low angle, with no noticeable camera movement throughout the sequence.",9xgnrykd7xrmr0cvvb4aqkjw8g,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_3_Initially_the_drone_9xgnrykd.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/Yo62jfMoJ0TAJC8H8RxdVeqTC2SBMLqqL1H6ifcqGW0TBgeXB/tmpwpfjp6m1.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:06.911Z,2026-01-20T09:43:06.227663395Z,5,16:9
job_2,rendered_dog_railhangar_front_1.00_50_2,"Initially, the dog plush toy had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The dog plush toy was then lifted smoothly upward from the floor, hovered at mid‑air for a short period with subtle vertical motion, and then descended and tipped forward into a head‑first fall onto the ground, after which it bounced and rolled slightly before pushing itself back up into a seated position, as if an invisible hand is first tossing it gently upward and then animating it to stand back up under its own effort. The viewpoint was fixed in front of the toy along the tracks with a constant central framing and stable perspective throughout.",t2wcns3bg9rmr0cvvb4bq25atc,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_2_Initially_the_dog_p_t2wcns3b.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/nhsYeKQeTTvBYkhgvpc6Xk7GuYH37KaKiSMfz1E5teCpEA9XB/tmp5jkgx4dz.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:06.466Z,2026-01-20T09:43:38.167690839Z,5,16:9
job_11,rendered_wolf_1.00_5_0,"Initially, the small cartoon wolf had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The wolf remained essentially fixed in position facing the camera, with only very subtle, almost imperceptible changes in limb and tail pose that look like tiny, smooth adjustments, as if a gentle, nearly constant stabilizing force is holding it in place with slight natural motion. The viewpoint was largely static in front of the wolf, with only minimal, smooth reframing or cropping shifts and a consistent sunset background staying in the same general alignment from start to finish.",ftr7113n9nrmy0cvvb4by3yrmc,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_11_Initially_the_small_ftr7113n.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/EYva6mVbwxaDKlA8OFu7MeSLQ5r1JZK6ui8YeXMxyGXzAQfrA/tmp7a8jw0rv.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:08.973Z,2026-01-20T09:43:16.052872607Z,5,16:9
job_6,rendered_horse_1.00_25_4,"Initially, the wooden rocking horse had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary on the carpet. The wooden rocking horse was then smoothly accelerated into a rocking motion, first tilting and lifting off the ground as if an invisible hand were pulling it backward and upward, causing it to swing through the air in a continuous arc. It reaches a mid‑air phase where it is fully off the carpet and continues its backward rock, then gradually swings forward again, descending and returning to make contact with the carpet, finally coming back to a near-resting rocking position similar to the initial pose. Throughout the sequence, the apparent motion is consistent with a single rigid 3D object rocking about its curved base in a physically plausible trajectory. The viewpoint was fixed in place in front of the horse, with no noticeable camera movement or change in perspective.",a16tdh38ydrmr0cvvb492228g8,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_6_Initially_the_woode_a16tdh38.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/x5m5IxSl6HJ0BlPqFo6ffayUtlfQtnSFAqGrF3I9dayLBgeXB/tmpzlr5uxlx.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:05.811Z,2026-01-20T09:43:01.223238807Z,5,16:9
job_5,rendered_frog_lilypad_1.00_10_0,"Initially, the frog had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary, and the lily pad and background also had an initial velocity of zero and were stationary. The frog was first sitting upright at the center of the lily pad and then gradually rotated and translated toward the back‑right side of the pad while lowering its body, as if a gentle, constant force were pulling it backward and down into a lying position; over time its head and torso smoothly sink and stretch forward, its eyes slowly close, and it ends curled up sleeping near the rear‑right edge of the pad. The lily pad itself was fixed in place and did not move, as if held motionless by an unseen support. The viewpoint was fixed in a frontal, slightly elevated position, maintaining the same camera angle and distance throughout the entire sequence.",bwdj81bacnrmt0cvvb4bajf908,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_5_Initially_the_frog__bwdj81ba.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/Hrui5wVbesTJP6ACJfHyOQsCCekBsF51yUJ1pIRQAdoqBgeXB/tmp82q88ley.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:06.181Z,2026-01-20T09:43:17.03615117Z,5,16:9
job_7,rendered_rabbit_1.00_5_2,"Initially, the rabbit had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The rabbit was then smoothly rotated in place while hovering above the ground, as if an invisible hand is gently spinning it around its vertical axis while keeping it roughly fixed in the air: it starts facing almost straight toward the viewer with a slight rightward angle, then turns gradually to its left profile, continues the rotation to show more of its right side, and finally returns toward a near-front-facing orientation. Throughout this, its ears and body orientation change consistently with the rotation, while its position in the frame and its height above the ground remain nearly constant, and the scattered crumbs on the floor stay fixed. The viewpoint was essentially static in front of the rabbit, with no noticeable camera translation or zoom, so the apparent motion is dominated by the rabbit’s own rotation.",5msvfvveysrmw0cvvb4bp7jt98,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_7_Initially_the_rabbi_5msvfvve.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/HZGpcf5lgfkRDUKceegDdJU3sXCbcE5ckr4cBYCFUpwqDA9XB/tmpv0_awd5s.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:07.35Z,2026-01-20T09:43:22.213468832Z,5,16:9
job_1,rendered_bear_factorysun_front_1.00_50_2,"Initially, the teddy bear had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary on the floor. The teddy bear was then accelerated smoothly upward into the air, hovered briefly while its legs dangled, and then decelerated back downward to sit again, after which it pitched forward and tipped over, finally falling flat and remaining motionless on the floor, as if an invisible vertical lifting force first pulled it straight up and then a gentle forward-tipping torque pushed its head and upper body down onto the floor. The viewpoint was fixed in a frontal position, maintaining a constant camera angle and distance toward the bear and the background throughout the sequence.",kvgha03dv5rmt0cvvb49b9h05r,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_1_Initially_the_teddy_kvgha03d.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/TyFjeFTEmIS3S6xpVDDL5fbGQRRbchQsQ6UMvbMViWpABQfrA/tmpc4tiznai.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:07.065Z,2026-01-20T09:43:28.680275913Z,5,16:9
job_9,rendered_teddy3_1.00_25_4,"Initially, the teddy bear had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The teddy bear was then lifted smoothly upward from the ground, hovered at mid‑air for a short duration, then descended back down to the ground and briefly leaned forward before repeating a smaller upward–downward bounce, as if an invisible vertical force is periodically pulling it straight up and letting it fall back under gravity. The viewpoint was fixed in a static, frontal position with no noticeable panning, rotation, or zoom throughout the sequence.",4nv4kqkgy5rmt0cvvb4bpdq444,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_9_Initially_the_teddy_4nv4kqkg.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/nEeMvDMCALWgAifSOyvEloye6iFADuMNH2f94Tf8hdDdHA6vC/tmprpcgvun3.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:07.857Z,2026-01-20T09:43:23.086604498Z,5,16:9
job_8,rendered_teddy1_1.00_25_4,"Initially, the teddy bear had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The teddy bear was then lifted smoothly upward from the ground into a hovering position, stayed suspended for a short moment, and subsequently descended, tipped over, and rolled/rotated along the floor, as if an invisible force were picking it up, letting it float, and then pushing it over so it tumbles across the ground. The viewpoint was fixed in place, maintaining the same frontal perspective on the bear and the room throughout the sequence.",5z2x5g3dyhrmy0cvvb48zqrbwr,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_8_Initially_the_teddy_5z2x5g3d.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/dXfSs35hV7yCIiXQczRLhMqLPsiEn6Z8RclBhOyfybuyAQfrA/tmpf45kn8wl.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:07.092Z,2026-01-20T09:43:14.372915979Z,5,16:9
job_0,rendered_bear_brokenroom_front_1.00_50_1,"Initially, the teddy bear had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary in mid-air. The teddy bear was then pulled slightly upward, hovered briefly, and gradually moved downward while beginning to rotate backward, eventually tipping over and falling onto its back on the floor, as if an invisible upward force briefly lifted and held it before gravity slowly rotated and dropped it onto the ground. The viewpoint was fixed in front of the bear and did not change, with no noticeable camera motion throughout the sequence.",qc157n3wfdrmw0cvvb4anpcw3w,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_0_Initially_the_teddy_qc157n3w.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/CdGlL1RdnhZKMt3gJnFsnsrrpjrcgTQdD7dl0VpK8ErSA0fKA/tmp8oxo8uad.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:10.811Z,2026-01-20T09:43:38.322156691Z,5,16:9

The blue toy car then slowly rotated in place from facing directly toward the camera to a slight angle toward the left side of the frame and gradually shifted a little farther away from the camera, as if a gentle twisting force is turning it and nudging it backward along the wooden floor. The viewpoint was fixed in a low, frontal position on the shiny wooden floor, with only the car’s pose and position changing while the background and camera remained static.",g7zpe2vqg9rmt0cvvb4bb0wnd0,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_s/job_10_Initially_the_blue__g7zpe2vq.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/otUVQormGzb7CtBizzSIUMb0OiY1NGws3ulCKlUdr2MMA0fKA/tmp1qahdoi5.mp4,2026-01-20T09:42:09.538Z,2026-01-20T09:43:12.653501706Z,5,16:9
