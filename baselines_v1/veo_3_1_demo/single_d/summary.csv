job_0,rendered_dollhouse_1.00_50_2,"Initially, the wooden dollhouse had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The dollhouse remained fixed in place from start to finish, as if an invisible force were holding it firmly on the floor without allowing any movement of the house itself. The viewpoint was smoothly orbiting around the dollhouse from a centered frontal view toward a three-quarter front-left view, as if a camera were moving along an arc around the house while maintaining a similar distance and height.",70xbn9fphsrmy0cvvb7tsntf5w,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_d/job_0_Initially_the_woode_70xbn9fp.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/d27RTvIQVII3FtnfzkiXnlkeiSzDgHVeZ2fh3Hgv2LWMiA9XB/tmpubuagqqg.mp4,2026-01-20T09:50:20.814Z,2026-01-20T09:51:32.108092628Z,5,16:9
job_1,rendered_toycar_1.00_25_3,"Initially, the blue toy car had an initial velocity of zero and was stationary. The blue toy car then began to rotate smoothly in place on the wooden floor, turning from directly facing the camera to a front‑three‑quarter angle and then to a clear side‑three‑quarter angle, as if an invisible hand is gently spinning it on the spot without noticeably translating it across the floor. The viewpoint was fixed in a low, centered position above the floor, maintaining the same perspective and distance while only the car’s orientation changed.",eh07ewfs0nrmt0cvvb7swn6m1w,/gemini/platform/public/aigc/zx/PhysOmni/baselines_v1/veo_3_1_demo/single_d/job_1_Initially_the_blue__eh07ewfs.mp4,downloaded,https://replicate.delivery/xezq/9Z0u3AY2Np5ff0hPwSWExLnDXWrP0feZkjJQiKkEPtjViA9XB/tmpzk9pgsrt.mp4,2026-01-20T09:50:21.445Z,2026-01-20T09:51:33.434094279Z,5,16:9
